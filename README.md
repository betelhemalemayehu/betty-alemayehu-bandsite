# Betty Alemayehu Bandsite

### Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to build a responsive and interactive band website that dynamically renders content through API integration and enhances user experience with modern web development practices.

---

### Sprint 1 Learnings:

- Applied a **component-based approach** to web development, leveraging **Flexbox** for website design.
- Utilized a **modular Sass** structure with variables and mixins to ensure a responsive design across all screen sizes (320px to 1920px).
- Experimented with **pseudo-classes** for hover effects, particularly in the **nav-bar** and **photo gallery**.

---

### Sprint 2 Learnings:

- Leveraged **JavaScript DOM methods** to dynamically render content (e.g., comments, shows) and manage **real-time updates** without page reloads.
- Programmed **form handling** to prevent default behavior, store and update data in arrays, and re-render the DOM based on user input (e.g., adding new comments).
- Implemented **event-driven interactivity** using `addEventListener` for form submissions and JavaScript to handle hover and selected states on UI components.

---

### Sprint 3 Learnings:

- Integrated **external APIs** using **axios** for real-time data updates (e.g., shows, comments), and implemented **advanced DOM manipulation** to manage UI states dynamically (e.g., selected states, form validation).
- Implemented **real-time form validation** with required fields that dynamically adjust based on input validity, ensuring UX-friendly feedback.
