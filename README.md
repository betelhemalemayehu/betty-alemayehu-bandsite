Sprint 1 Learnings:

- Applied a component approach to web development, leveraging flex box for design
- Utilized a modular Sass structure with variables and mixins to ensure responsive design across all screen sizes (320px to 1920px)
- Experimented with psuedo-classes for hover effects (visible in the nav-bar and photo gallery)

Sprint 2 Learnings:

- Leveraged JavaScript DOM methods to dynamically render content (e.g., comments, shows) and manage real-time updates without page reloads
- Programmed form handling to prevent default behavior, store and update data in arrays, and re-render the DOM based on user input (e.g., adding new comments)
- Implemented event-driven interactivity using addEventListener for form submissions, and JavaScript to handle hover and selected states on UI components
